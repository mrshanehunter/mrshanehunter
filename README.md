#### Background:

#### 2020:

Was not a great year to be a freelance marketer servicing SMEs. Accepting an offer from Generation Australia to enrol in their Junior Web Developer course was my way of "pivoting". 

#### Web Development:

Prior to completing the Generation course \(HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap\) website builds had to be outsourced.
