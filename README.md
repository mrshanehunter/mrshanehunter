#### Background:

Learned the practical side of brand marketing in a blue chip environment and since then have worked on a broad range of brands across very diverse industries for all types of business structures.  That journey taught me how to fit process to situation - applying only the critical elements required to fully satisfy an objective effectively and efficiently.  That skill has been a massive benefit while picking up coding skills I last used at uni

#### 2020:

Was not a great year to be a freelance marketer servicing SMEs. Accepting an offer from **Generation Australia** to enrol in their **Junior Web Developer** course was my way of "pivoting". Most of the year was spent studying, ultimately to broaden my offering in the freelance space. 

#### Web Development:

Prior to completing the Generation course \(**HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript** and **Bootstrap**\) website builds had to be outsourced. Learning how to build one myself seemed like a natural service extension. Containing the crafting of the story, contexts for different audiences and creative execution across touchpoints \(websites usually being the biggest touchpoint\) is vital for clarity and continuity.  Eliminating a link in the creative chain significantly increases the levels both. 

#### Frameworks & Libraries:

Continuing to practice pretty much daily after the course ended, I very quickly realised that the vision I had for some of the sites I was building couldn't be achieved with JavaScript alone. Challenging myself with a steep learning curve I've been delving into more courses on **React JS**, **Redux**, **Gatsby**, and some **Next JS**, along with **Node JS**, headless CMS and serverless functions, and some **GraphQL**.

#### Focus:

Working with SMEs and challenger brands in their markets to craft their story properly in order to engage and create an enduring connection with customers. For most customers, the first real contact they have with a brand is the website.  Bringing the design and development into the core of brand planning, so it looks, feels and is part of the story, not an afterthought, is my goal.

#### Connect with me:

Via my website - [That Guy From Marketing](https://www.thatguyfrommarketing.com), or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shane-hunter), or send me an [Email](webdev@thatguyfrommarketing.com)

#### Open to Opportunities:

Short or long term contracts, and project-based work in the brand-marketing space is ideal.  Finding that coding up designs is almost obsessive I'm not averse to the idea of a full-time role designinng and building websites.  

Also very open to working with more tech-savvy web-developers to help bring greater clariity to the brand, story and customer elements of their designs and builds. 

#### Current Projects:

Juggling the development of two e-commerce web apps (one as practice, one as a personal project) using Gatsby with applying a brand refresh to my business site (in stages).  When at least 2 are done, I'm lining up a full stack e-commerce site.
